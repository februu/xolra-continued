# xolra🌳

### My own rougelike survival game

❗  __This project is discontinued, however I didn't give up on Xolra. I just changed the whole concept and this repo became slightly irrelevant.__
Link to new repo here: `soon`

My second game developed in C++. After big success of [Island Defenders](https://github.com/februu/island-defenders) :tftf:, ya boi decided to make another game but this time inspired by his favourite games including Minecraft, Terraria and The Binding of Isaac.

_Currently, work in progress. ☕_
