### My own rougelike survival game

My second game developed in C++. After big success of [Island Defenders](https://github.com/februu/island-defenders) :tftf:, ya boi decided to make another game but this time inspired by his favourite games including Minecraft, Terraria and The Binding of Isaac.

_Currently, work in progress. ☕_
